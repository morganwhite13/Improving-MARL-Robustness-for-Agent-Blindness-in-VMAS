# Improving-MARL-Robustness-for-Agent-Blindness-in-VMAS
A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning research project investigating how swarm agents handle partial observability through random "blindness" events. Built custom blindness scenarios in VMAS where agents lose sensory input unpredictably, testing whether cooperative strategies can emerge despite information loss.
